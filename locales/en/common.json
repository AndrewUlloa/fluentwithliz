  "aboutMyStory": "My Story",
  "aboutMyStory1": "I'm Liz, and I'm from New York. I grew up here, went to school here, and I'm an educator specializing in teaching English to foreigners. But my journey with language learning started long before I became a teacher.",
  "aboutMyStory2": "My dad was born in Colombia, and growing up, I witnessed firsthand the difficulties he faced assimilating into American life. He never taught my sister or me Spanish—not a single word. It wasn't until I got older that I realized how much that said without literally saying anything.",
  "aboutMyStory3": "I remember having identity issues because I didn't fit in with the white kids here, and I didn't fit in with the Hispanic kids here. I just didn't really know who I was, and I felt like a part of me was really missing.",
  "aboutMyStory4": "Then I studied abroad in Spain, and I was just around Spanish all the time. I fell in love with it. Even now, it's like my preferred language because it's just so much more funny and descriptive. The Tuesday is like so much better.",
  "aboutMyStory5": "I studied hard and earned my C1 certificate in Spanish. Of course, I still make mistakes, but I have that certificate, and more importantly, I have that connection to a language that feels like home.",
  "aboutWhyLanguageMatters": "Why Language Matters",
  "aboutWhyLanguage1": "Learning Spanish was a big deal for me for two reasons. First, it brought me closer to my extended family and my origins. My grandmother took care of us while my parents worked two or three jobs. I'm one of the only grandkids who can speak Spanish and speak to her.",
  "aboutWhyLanguage2": "It was almost this strange dynamic where you feel their love through their actions and behaviors, but you can't ever communicate with them. That connection through language is priceless.",
  "aboutWhyLanguage3": "The other part is this: I feel like having another language is like having another soul. When you have all those different souls, it kind of makes up who you are. So I take that with me—appreciate your native language, but at the same time, explore the other identities that coexist within you.",
  "aboutMyApproach": "My Approach",
  "aboutApproach1": "With language learning, I know what it's like to really struggle with that. There's a lot of vulnerability involved, and I feel like I do a good job tenderly approaching language with my students.",
  "aboutApproach2": "Globally, learning English is what's going to give you a lot of opportunities. It's the number one language that everyone communicates in, and that people at this point kind of expect you to know. But I'm able to teach it in a way that also incorporates your first language, honoring that native soul, while also helping you find out your identity in English.",
  "aboutApproach3": "I prefer group classes because there are more opportunities for authentic interaction. When it's one-on-one, students sometimes depend on you to carry the conversation. In a group, there are different ideas, and it ends up being more fun and productive.",
  "aboutApproach4": "I specialize in teaching adults—people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Adults take it more seriously. They're motivated because they need English to unlock life or career opportunities, not because someone is forcing them.",
  "aboutTransformation": "The Transformation",
  "aboutTransformation1": "I've had students come to me who couldn't even say one full sentence. Then, a few years later, they're going to college in America, studying to be doctors. They tell me, \"You have no idea where I came from. We don't even have public toilets in our house, and now I'm studying to be a doctor. No one ever told me I could do any of those things.\"",
  "aboutTransformation2": "For us, it might be sitting across from somebody, teaching them and correcting them for an hour. But for them, it might be the start of the rest of their life.",
  "aboutTransformation3": "Everyone always tells me that they feel a lot more confident and motivated to practice. That's what I'm here for—not just to teach English, but to help you see what this journey can mean for the rest of your life.",
  "aboutWhatToExpect": "What to Expect",
  "aboutWhatToExpectArrival": "When you arrive, I want you to feel curious, open-minded, trusting in the process, and positive.",
  "aboutWhatToExpectDeparture": "By the time you leave, I want you to feel empowered, confident, motivated, supported, fulfilled, and hopeful.",
  "aboutWhatToExpect13": "This is for the student who really wants to learn and value this experience with the same intentionality. You can sense it when you meet with them—that motivation, that curiosity, that investment in their own growth.",
  "aboutCTAReady": "Ready to start your English journey?",
  "aboutCTADescription": "Join motivated adult English learners who are ready to unlock new opportunities.",
  "faqSubtitle": "Common questions about classes, teaching approach, and what to expect.",
  "faqQuestion1": "What age groups do you teach?",
  "faqAnswer1": "I specialize in teaching adults—people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Adults take it more seriously. They're motivated because they need English to unlock life or career opportunities, not because someone is forcing them.",
  "faqQuestion2": "Do you offer group classes or individual classes?",
  "faqAnswer2": "I offer both! I prefer group classes because there are more opportunities for authentic interaction. When it's one-on-one, students sometimes depend on you to carry the conversation. In a group, there are different ideas, and it ends up being more fun and productive. However, individual classes are available for advanced students ready for intensive coaching.",
  "faqQuestion3": "How does the module-based system work?",
  "faqAnswer3": "I prefer module-based classes on a semester basis. It's way less work for you, and provides more structure for your learning journey. You enroll for a semester, and we work through structured modules together. This approach gives you clear progress markers and a sense of accomplishment as you complete each module.",
  "faqQuestion4": "What makes your teaching approach different?",
  "faqAnswer4": "I know what it's like to really struggle with language learning. There's a lot of vulnerability involved, and I feel like I do a good job tenderly approaching language with my students. I'm able to teach English in a way that also incorporates your first language, honoring that native soul, while also helping you find out your identity in English.",
  "faqQuestion5": "How much do classes cost?",
  "faqAnswer5": "Group classes are $200 per module, divided by 5 students (so $40 per person). Individual classes are $40-45 per hour for advanced students ready for intensive coaching. Group classes offer more accessible pricing while still providing quality instruction.",
  "faqQuestion6": "What should I expect when I arrive?",
  "faqAnswer6": "When you arrive, I want you to feel curious, open-minded, trusting in the process, and positive. By the time you leave, I want you to feel empowered, confident, motivated, supported, fulfilled, and hopeful.",
  "faqQuestion7": "Do I need to be at a certain level to join?",
  "faqAnswer7": "This is for the student who really wants to learn and value this experience with the same intentionality. You can sense it when you meet with them—that motivation, that curiosity, that investment in their own growth. Whether you're a beginner or advanced, if you're motivated and ready to invest in your learning, you're welcome.",
  "faqQuestion8": "Can I try a class before committing?",
  "faqAnswer8": "Yes! Book a free call with me to discuss your goals and see if we're a good fit. This gives us both a chance to understand what you're looking for and whether my teaching style aligns with your learning needs.",
